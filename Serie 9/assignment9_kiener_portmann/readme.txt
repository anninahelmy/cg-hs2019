Assignment 9 - Joana Portmann, Ann Kiener

1) 1D Perlin Noise:
Thanks to the detailed described assignment sheet, we were able to follow it step by step and 
the implementing was really straightforward.




4) Terrain:
Again this was very straightforward because the information on the assignment sheet helped a lot.
Especially the Figure 8 helped when covering each grid sqaure with two triangles, so we did could just
copy the information from the picture. It was actually difficult to implement the Phong Model, because
we had to rethink each value and think about each value and how to compute it.
